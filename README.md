# GTD
### Overview 

This repository contains code for analyzing the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) using machine learning techniques. 

The project focuses on two classification tasks:

Binary Classification: Predicting whether a terrorist attack was successful (success).

Multi-Class Classification: Predicting the type of attack (attacktype1_txt).

The code uses ensemble learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, to perform these tasks. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
